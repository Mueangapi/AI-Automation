They mentioned about what jobs and skills are in demand for the next 5 years, and what jobs are gonna be less needed!

It's interesting but I didn't have much time to read it. So.. let's find some solutions!

## 1st Chapter I need an assistant.
and here is what i found https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works

So I try implementing it using Streamlit🍁(Clone my repo and run app.py)
```
$ cd app
$ streamlit run app.py
```

After took a journey I found so many possibilities, felt like having unlocked the ability to learn new thing quickly📖. As long as the assistant could simplify.

I found something really cauth my eye👀 as a current worker at a bank, It's the top lowest jobs here.

As an economics graduated like me, it's well known that the whole economy is run by credit. and I think I could find the gap in this opportunity.📊

## 2nd Chapter Gathering infos and requirments.
